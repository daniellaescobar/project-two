      <h1>It's the perfect place to start your new life</h1>
      <p class="p-one">
        Stardew Valley is an open-ended country-life RPG! You’ve inherited your
        grandfather’s old farm plot in Stardew Valley. Armed with hand-me-down
        tools and a few coins, you set out to begin your new life. Can you learn
        to live off the land and turn these overgrown fields into a thriving
        home? It won’t be easy. Ever since Joja Corporation came to town, the
        old ways of life have all but disappeared. The community center, once
        the town’s most vibrant hub of activity, now lies in shambles. But the
        valley seems full of opportunity. With a little dedication, you might
        just be the one to restore Stardew Valley to greatness!

        Pelican Town is where the player moves to at the start of the game,
        located in Stardew Valley. Pelican Town is where most of the villagers
        live, work, and socialize. Lewis is the mayor of Pelican Town and has
        been for over 20 years; he comments that he has not had competition for
        the role since first becoming mayor. The northwest entrance to town
        connects to the Bus Stop and The Farm. The southwest passage connects to
        Cindersap Forest, which contains Marnie's Ranch, Leah's Cottage, and the
        Wizard's Tower. Directly south of town is The Beach. North of town
        connects to The Mountain, with Robin's carpenter shop, the mines, the
        Adventurer's Guild, the Railroad, and the Quarry. Initially, there are
        weeds located near 2 Willow Lane, in the area behind 1 Willow Lane,
        behind JojaMart, and to the west of the Community Center, below the
        playground. These weeds will die during Winter, but will respawn at the
        start of each new year.
