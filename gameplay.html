          Stardew Valley is an open-ended game, allowing the player to achieve
          goals non-linearly. There are various ways to earn income and many
          activities to choose from including farming, fishing, foraging,
          mining, combat (fighting enemies), crafting, cooking, gift giving,
          completing quests, donating to the Museum and restoring the Community
          Center.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          To level up skills, the player must complete certain actions related
          to that skill. Farming XP is earned by harvesting a fully grown crop
          and taking care of animals. Foraging XP is earned by foraging or
          chopping down trees. Mining XP is earned by breaking rocks and ore
          deposits. Fishing and using crab pots will increase fishing XP.
          Killing monsters will increase combat XP.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As the skill level increases, the player will earn crafting recipes
          (every level except level 5 and 10) or professions (on level 5 and
          10).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Professions (level 5 and 10) can give the player a boost on yielding
          products, including more products gained, additional selling price,
          using less inventories and others. The player's choice of a level 5
          profession will determine which profession choices are available at
          level 10.

        Players can select from seven different farm maps. Each map offers
        unique benefits, and favors specific skills. After selecting a map, it
        cannot be changed, characters are permanently tied to their map type
        once created. Space-wise each map takes up the same area, but there are
        different amounts of usable/farmable/buildable land on each.
